        <div class="faq-answer">
          EMI, or 'Easy Monthly Installments,' is like a budget-friendly magic
          trick for buying stuff. It's your secret weapon when you want that new
          gadget or dreamy sofa but don't want to drop all your cash at once.
          With EMI, you break down the cost into bite-sized chunks, usually
          every month, covering both the cool thing you're getting and a bit of
          interest. It's like getting what you want without playing
          hide-and-seek with your wallet. So, go ahead, splurge a little, and
          let EMI be your money-savvy sidekick!

          To apply for EMI, it's a breeze! If you have a credit card, just
          select the Apply EMI option during your purchase. If not, no worries â€“
          gather your salary certificate, bank statements, citizenship proof,
          and a passport-sized photo. Head to the EMI application section on the
          website, fill in your details, upload the required documents, and
          voila! Your ticket to easy payments is just a few clicks away. Now,
          you can enjoy your favorite buys without breaking the bank!
