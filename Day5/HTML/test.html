        <div class="faq-answer">
          EMI, or 'Easy Monthly Installments,' is like a budget-friendly magic
          trick for buying stuff. It's your secret weapon when you want that new
          gadget or dreamy sofa but don't want to drop all your cash at once.
          With EMI, you break down the cost into bite-sized chunks, usually
          every month, covering both the cool thing you're getting and a bit of
          interest. It's like getting what you want without playing
          hide-and-seek with your wallet. So, go ahead, splurge a little, and
          let EMI be your money-savvy sidekick!
