            If the product is of good quality, the buyer has the right to
            terminate the contract concluded at a distance within 14 days after
            its execution.
          </p>
          <p class="text-[18px] font-opensans">
            In order for the right to terminate the agreement to be preserved,
            the consumer needs to monitor the preservation of the products in
            their original state. If the device is destroyed, damaged or damaged
            through no fault of the customer, the customer is not deprived of
            the opportunity to terminate the contract. If the value has
            decreased due to unpacking the product or checking its
            functionality, this does not mean that the consumer cannot write a
            request for a refund.

            Then the question arises: where’s the content? Not there yet? That’s
            not so bad, there’s dummy copy to the rescue. But worse, what if the
            fish doesn’t fit in the can, the foot’s to big for the boot? Or to
            small? To short sentences, to many headings, images too large for
            the proposed design, or too small, or they fit in but it looks iffy
            for reasons.

            A client that’s unhappy for a reason is a problem, a client that’s
            unhappy though he or her can’t quite put a finger on it is worse.
            Chances are there wasn’t collaboration, communication, and
            checkpoints, there wasn’t a process agreed upon or specified with
            the granularity required. It’s content strategy gone awry right from
            the start. If that’s what you think how bout the other way around?
            How can you evaluate content without design? No typography, no
            colors, no layout, no styles, all those things that convey the
            important signals that go beyond the mere textual, hierarchies of
            information, weight, emphasis, oblique stresses, priorities, all
            those subtle cues that also have visual and emotional appeal to the
            reader.
