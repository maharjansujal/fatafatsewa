            If the product is of good quality, the buyer has the right to
            terminate the contract concluded at a distance within 14 days after
            its execution.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for the right to terminate the agreement to be preserved,
            the consumer needs to monitor the preservation of the products in
            their original state. If the device is destroyed, damaged or damaged
            through no fault of the customer, the customer is not deprived of
            the opportunity to terminate the contract. If the value has
            decreased due to unpacking the product or checking its
            functionality, this does not mean that the consumer cannot write a
            request for a refund.
          </p>
          <h2>
            The product is not accepted back if at least one of the components
            is missing:

            Then the question arises: where's the content? Not there yet? That's
            not so bad, there's dummy copy to the rescue. But worse, what if the
            fish doesn't fit in the can, the foot's to big for the boot? Or to
            small? To short sentences, to many headings, images too large for
            the proposed design, or too small, or they fit in but it looks iffy
            for reasons.
